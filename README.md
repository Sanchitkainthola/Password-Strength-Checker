# Password-Strength-Checker
This Python project lets you check whether your password is strong enough. It does this by checking the number of letters, numbers, special characters, and whitespace characters within a given password and generating a score based on these results. So, it’s another great way to learn about conditional statements, functions, and string formatting. We also use the string and getpass modules from the Python standard library. This allows us to access the full range of string characters to compare with our password’s character composition, while the .getpass() function lets us hide our password when we enter it.
